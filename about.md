## About Me
#### I am currently an industrial engineer for the United Parcel Service (UPS). Upon my graduation in May 2024 I plan to take my skill sets I have developed as an industrial engineer and combine them with my academic studies to move my career towards applications developemnt. After spending much time with developers I belive I can leverage my existing operational knowledge to better facilitate and steamline projects that will have a positive impact on the UPS operation as a whole.
